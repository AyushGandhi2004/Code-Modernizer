IMPROVEMENTS :
-> Can implement an extra check in the tester that run the original and the new code and check if their outputs
    are same or not.

->Implement RAG for providing specific Documentations of particular languages that are new and llm helucinates for that

->Can make it available for more languages and framework

->Can make it a MCP Server so that different llms can use it as tool

->Can add PII detection i.e lets say the code file has a API key hardcoded in it, then the PII layer will replace it and map it with some variable and at the end before delivering it will replace it again

->Can implement github tools like we give a link of github repo in input and it will convert the complete codebas in the repo into newer version. i think this can be done by making this a MCP server and then can work as tool for github






Highlights:
-Streaming langgraph used  and therefore streamingAPI calls used
